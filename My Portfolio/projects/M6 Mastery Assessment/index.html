        Cooper is my Golden Retriever who never leaves my side. He is our protection, our friend, and 
        a big part of our family. 
        
        <p>The Coop brings laughter, frustration, but more improtantly love.</p>

          <li><em><b>Cooper</b></em></li>
          <p>
            Oh Coop! How he digs up my backyard. You would think he was digging to put in a swimming pool!!
            The Coop eats the brick off our house, eats wood, stones and I just do not know what else. When we
            get on to him, he just looks at you like nothing has happen. 
            
            <p><em>Whatcha talking about, I'm innocent!</em></p>
          </p>
          <li><em><b>Playful Cooper</b></em></li>
          <p>
            My dog Cooper is crazy! He runs across the floor so he can slide
            into the back door, and loves to chase and bite his tail.
          </p>
          <li><em><b>My Best Friend</b></em></li>
          <p>
            At times when he makes me furious, I can do nothing but love him.
            Everyhting he does for me and forgives me, its all I can do for him.
